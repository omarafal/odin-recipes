        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This will show a step-by-step recipe to make a wonderful looking carrot cake at home.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Sugars: </b>You'll need white sugar for the cake and confectioners' sugar for the frosting.</li>
            <li><b>Oil: </b>A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, adds moisture without imparting flavor.</li>
            <li><b>Eggs: </b>Four whole eggs lend moisture and help bind the carrot cake batter together.</li>
            <li><b>Vanilla: </b>Two teaspoons of vanilla extract for the cake (and one teaspoon for the frosting) enhances the flavor.</li>
            <li><b>Flour: </b>All-purpose flour creates structure and brings the batter together.</li>
            <li><b>Leaveners: </b>Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the cake rise.</li>
            <li><b>Cinnamon: </b>Ground cinnamon adds that warm, cozy flavor you associate with carrot cake.</li>
            <li><b>Salt: </b>Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cake taste salty.</li>
            <li><b>Carrots: </b>Of course, you'll need grated carrots!</li>
            <li><b>Pecans: </b>Chopped pecans give the cake and frosting a pleasant crunch.</li>
            <li><b>Butter: </b> and <b>cream cheese</b>Butter and cream cheese are the key ingredients in the light and fluffy cream cheese frosting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><b>Make the batter: </b>Beat the wet ingredients together, then mix in the dry ingredients. Stir in the carrots and fold in the pecans.</li>
            <li><b>Bake the cake: </b>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan or pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
            <li><b>Frost the cake: </b>Beat the frosting ingredients together until smooth and creamy. Stir in the pecans. Frost the (completely cooled) cake.</li>
        </ol>
